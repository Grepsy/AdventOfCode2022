# Advent of Code 2022 - .NET Solutions

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2022 repository! This repository contains my solutions for the Advent of Code 2022 challenges, implemented in .NET.

## About

Advent of Code is an annual event that takes place in December, offering a series of daily programming puzzles. These puzzles are a great way to improve your coding skills, learn new algorithms, and have fun during the holiday season. This repository serves as my personal collection of solutions for the 2023 edition.

## Structure

The repository is organized into folders by day, with each folder containing the solution for the corresponding day's challenge. Each solution includes:

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point of the solution.
- `DayXX.cs`: The implementation of the solution for that day.
- `dayXX.txt`: The input data for the puzzle.
